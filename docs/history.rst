Changelog
---------

Tip: (unreleased)
  * ``LOCALE_INDEPENDENT_PATHS`` can now be plain string regular expressions,
    they don't have to be compiled regex objects. Fixes #9.
  * Added import of ``localeurl.models`` to ``localeurl.middleware``, to ensure
    that ``reverse`` is monkeypatched before any requests are
    served. Fixes #5. Thanks Antti Kaihola for the report, Andrey Shipilov and
    jefurii for fix confirmation.
  * Added iri_to_uri encoding of non-ASCII redirect URLs. Fixes #13.
  * Sorted language codes longest-first to avoid matching e.g. 'pt' before
    'pt-br'. Fixes #15. Thanks Roman Barczyński for report and draft patch.
  * Added ``LOCALE_INDEPENDENT_STATIC_URL`` setting to mirror
    ``LOCALE_INDEPENDENT_MEDIA_URL``. This setting defaults to True, so if you
    want URLs under STATIC_URL to be locale-dependent, you will need to set it
    to False.
  * Fixed middleware redirection when there is a script
    prefix. Fixes #10. Thanks iro for report and draft patch.
  * Added ``localeurl_future`` template tag library to provide ``locale_url``
    tag that wraps the new Django ``url`` tag to allow using the new syntax and
    avoid deprecation warnings under Django 1.3. Fixes #17. Thanks Fabian
    Büchler for the report.
  * Accounted for reverse() receiving kwargs=None. Fixes #18. Thanks Alexander
    Clausen for report and tests, Joel Ryan for draft patch.
  * Prevented change_locale view from stripping query params from ``next``.
    Fixes #7. Thanks Sverre Johansen.

Release 1.4: (2010-03-19)
  * Moved localeurl settings from localeurl/__init__.py to
    localeurl/settings.py.
  * Added ``LocaleurlSitemap`` for easier creation of multilingual
    sitemaps.
  * Added ``LOCALEURL_USE_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE`` setting to check HTTP
    Accept-Language header before resorting to
    ``settings.LANGUAGE_CODE`` when locale is not specified in URL.
  * Switched to 301 permanent redirects for no-locale URL redirect.
  * Moved to `BitBucket`_ for source code hosting.
  * Added the ``change_locale`` view, contributed by Panos Laganakos.

Release 1.3: (2009-04-06)
  * Changed chlocale tag to strip prefix of locale-independent paths.
  * Moved the monkey-patching of urlresolvers.reverse to models.py.
  * Removed ``REDIRECT_LOCALE_INDEPENDENT_PATHS`` settings option; this is now
    the default.

Release 1.2: (2009-01-19):
  * Moved the documentation into the source tree. (Based on `a blog post`_ by
    Andi Albrecht.)
  * Released version 1.2.

Release 1.1: (2008-11-20):
  * Added the ``PREFIX_DEFAULT_LOCALE`` settings option contributed by Jonas
    Christian.
  * Added ``REDIRECT_LOCALE_INDEPENDENT_PATHS`` settings option.

  * Added Django 1.0 or higher as a prerequisite.
  * Moved to Google Code.

localeurl was developed by `Joost Cassee`_ based on the work by Atli
Þorbjörnsson. Contributions by Jonas Christian. Includes code from the
`django-localize`_ project by `Artiom Diomin`_. Currently maintained
by `Carl Meyer`_.

It was partly taken from and partly inspired by discussions on the
django-users_ and django-multilingual_ mailinglists:

 * Atli Þorbjörnsson: `Locale from URL Middleware`_
 * Panos Laganakos: `creating a multilingual middleware`_
 * Piotr Majewski: `multilingual middleware NEW FEATURE!`_

See also `this blog post on internationalisation`_ by Yann Malet that
references Atli's code.
